The combined datasets were shuffled with a fixed seed to randomize the examples, ensuring that the model does not learn in a biased sequence. For evaluation purposes, the testing dataset was limited to 100 samples to streamline validation during development.\n",

The tokenizer plays a critical role in converting text data into numerical tokens that the model can process. While the primary goal of our model is to transcribe Twi, we faced a unique challenge: the tokenizer does not explicitly support Twi. Additionally, our dataset occasionally included English words mixed with Twi, a common linguistic phenomenon.\n",

By adopting this approach, we ensured that the model could effectively tokenize and process mixed-language transcriptions without losing important linguistic nuances."

This step was crucial for overcoming inconsistencies in the dataset, which could arise from variations in the sampling rates of audio files collected from different sources.\n",

Without standardization, the model's performance could degrade due to mismatched input features or processing errors."
